### Implementing the $1 Gesture Recognizer (4/4P)
* $1 gesture recognizer works and is efficiently implemented
    * yep (2P)
* Five gestures can be distinguished
    * yep (1P)
* Gesture entry user interface
    * yep (1P)


### Mid-Air Gestures with $1 Recognizer (4/6P)
* Pose detection works reliably and with low latency
    * yep (1P)
* Mapping of landmarks to a pointer position works
    * pointer movement could have been only in the recognizer window, not the whole desktop(s) (-0.5P)
* Application controls the mouse pointer
    * yep (2P)
* Mid-air gesture interaction is integrated into $1 recognizer
    * not working (0P)
* Recording works and recorded ata is stored appropriately
    * no correct timestamps (-0.5P)

### Comparing Gesture Recognizers (0/5P)
* missing

### Gesture Detection Game (3.5/5P)
* Gesture input works with touchpad/mouse and mid-air
    * mid-air not working correctly (-0.5P)
* Functionality and aesthetics of the application
    * basic aesthetics (0P)
    * really cool idea with the new gestures (and nicely chosen)
* Three gestures are distinguished robustly
    * yep (2P)
